# Ether
A "game" written in PyGame that exists for me to test stuff.

# How to run
Install pygame and run main.py to run

# Flexing
The game runs at 60 fps, the framerate is reduced here to reduce filesize

# Todo
- Add enemies and enemy spawners
- Add more "combat arts"
- Add gridlines or some kind of background (starfield?)
- Maybe add zooming and rotating camera just because I can
- maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe multihreading
