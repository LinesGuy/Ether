# Ether
A "game" written in Python that exists for me to test stuff.

*How do I run it?*

please dont

But if you must, install pygame and numpy then run main.py.

*Why is it called Ether?*

The game is loosely based from a flash game from ~2012 that I'm pretty sure is called Ether but I can't find it anymore.
