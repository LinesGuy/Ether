# Ether
A "game" written in Python that exists for me to test stuff.


*How do I run it?*

please dont

But if you must, install pygame and numpy then run main.py.


*Where are all the other files?*

Everything is in main.py, there are no sprites, **everything** is drawn using lines and circles. I might change it so classes are in separate files if I'm feeling cute.


*Why is it called Ether?*

The game is loosely based from a flash game from ~2012 that I'm pretty sure is called Ether but I can't find it anymore.
